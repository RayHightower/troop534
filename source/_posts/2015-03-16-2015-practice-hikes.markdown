The first practice hike for the Lincoln Trail will begin at 8:00am on Saturday, March 29, 2014.

We will follow the same path as last yearâ€™s first hike:

Start: 39th Street & Lake Shore Drive
Turnaround: Shedd Acquarium
End: 39th Street & Lake Shore Drive
Distance = 6.6 miles.
Estimated Completion time: 11am, depending on the pace of the slowest Scout
Please arrive before 8am. We will spend ten minutes stretching, and we will hit the trail immediately after that.

What should Scouts bring for the hike? As always, remember the Scout Motto: Be Prepared. For the short practice hikes, be sure to bring:

Water.
Energy bars.
Hiking boots.
Wool socks.
Rain poncho.
