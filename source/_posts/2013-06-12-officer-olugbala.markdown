My name it's Assata Olugbala and I am a Chicago Police Officer. This year I will be participating in the 2013 Cycle Across Illinois . The ride consists of about 50 riders and will begin In Alton , Illinois on the 17th of July and end at Chicago Public Safety Headquarters July 21st. This annual ride is the largest fundraising event for Illinois Concerns of Police Survivors.
