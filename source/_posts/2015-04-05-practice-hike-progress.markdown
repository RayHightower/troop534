Scouts, parents, and leaders from Troop 534 "Hey!" gathered at Lake Shore Drive for our second Lincoln Trail Practice Hike on Saturday, April 4, 2015.

The day's distance: Seven miles. Over the next few weeks we will build up to the 18-mile Lincoln Trail challenge!

If you're a member of the Troop, be sure to come on out to prepare for the Lincoln Trail. Group practice, in the form of the scheduled practice hikes, is one of the best ways to get ready.
