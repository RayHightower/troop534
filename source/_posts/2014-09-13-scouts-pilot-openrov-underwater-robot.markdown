Members of Boy Scout Troop 534 took an [OpenROV underwater robot](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/) for a spin in Lake Michigan on Saturday morning. The weather was cold (in the 40s in September) but the OpenROV held its own in the choppy lake water.

###What the Group Learned
Science is all about learning from experiments, whether the experiments are successful or not. Here are a few things learned during today's water venture:

* The OpenROV thrusters can handle themselves very well, even in choppy water.
* You never know how the lake might behave. Dress warm and wear waterproof boots.
* If the lake is choppy on the surface, the water is probably kicking up silt down below. Visibility might be limited.

###Next Time
The scouts are planning another tour, perhaps in a calmer body of
water. Stay tuned for more updates about Boy Scout Troop 534 and
OpenROV!
