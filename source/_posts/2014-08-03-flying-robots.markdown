An unmanned arial vehicle (UAV) is simply a flying robot. Some people call them drones. [Accenture](http://accenture.com/), the global consulting firm, has prepared a 12-page report describing opportunities that involve UAVs.

Title of the report: [Itâ€™s Time for Flying Robots](/downloads/Flying-Robots-Accenture.pdf). Worthwhile reading for anyone interested in science, engineering, or business.
