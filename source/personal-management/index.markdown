Personal Management Merit Badge is about managing time and money. The purpose of this merit badge is to teach all of us (scouts and instructors) to do the following:

1. Manage Time.

2. Manage Money.

3. Eliminate Excuses.

The symbols on the badge are clear: Half dollar sign, half clock face. Time and money.

###Why Personal Management is Required
Leaders achieve goals. Goals require time and money, and both of these are limited resources. In order to achieve our goals, we must manage our time and money well.

###How to Get Started

1. First, download the [Personal Mangement PDF at MeritBadge.org](http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Personal_management).  Read through the questions. Most of the questions will appear mysterious at first. That's fine. Think of the growth you will achieve after you complete the merit badge.

2. Answer the questions that you can answer.

3. 

###Why Manage Time?
There are only 168 hours in a week. 24 hours in a day. We need to manage those hours well in order to get the most out of life and achieve the things we want to achieve.



###Conclusion
Every time we do this merit badge, several people ask me questions that I don't know the answer to. And that's when we go on the hunt for knowledge and we learn together.
